# AirPods Sound Quality Fixer And Battery Life Enhancer For MacOS

Fixes sound quality drops when using AirPods with Macs. 
It forces the default audio input to be the built-in microphone instead of AirPods' microphone so MacOS doesn't have to mix down the output. 
It also increases battery life because AirPods doesn't have to broadcast sound back.
If you have more input devices you can select which device you want to force over the AirPods microphone.

The app runs in the menu bar.

Coincidentally also works for all bidirectional capable Bluetooth devices as well.

Download the compiled and notarized application from [releases](https://github.com/kode54/airpodssoundqualityfixer/releases/tag/1.0), works on macOS 10.13 and up.
